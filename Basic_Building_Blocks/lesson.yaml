  Course: STS ST07
  Lesson: Workspace Directories and Files
  Author: David Kane and Rebecca Dauwe
  Type: Standard
  Organization: UPJV
  Version: 0.1.2

- Class: text
  Output: "In this lesson, you'll learn how to examine your local workspace in R 
    and begin to explore the interaction between R and the file 
    system of your machine. First we have a look at the workspace."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can list all the objects in your local workspace using ls(). 
    "Local workspace" refers to what is loaded or created in R's memory that can be accessed 
    in this session. Closing R wipes this local memory clean.
  CorrectAnswer: ls()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ls()')
  Hint: Type ls() to view all the objects in your local workspace.
  
- Class: text
  Output: If you are continuing from the previous lesson (Basic_Building_Blocks) without 
    closing R or RStudio, you will likely notice that the variables you created are still
    in R's memory, or local workspace.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Similar to the previous lesson, let's assign 9 to x using x <- 9.
  CorrectAnswer: x <- 9
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='x <- 9')
  Hint: Type x <- 9 to assign 9 to x.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now take another look at the objects that are in your workspace using ls().
  CorrectAnswer: ls()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ls()')
  Hint: Type ls() to view all the objects in your workspace.
  
- Class: text
  Output: What has changed? If "x" was already present from the previous class, 
    you will have over-written it with the new content.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, determine which directory your R session is using as its current 
    working directory using getwd(). 
  CorrectAnswer: getwd()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='getwd()')
  Hint: Type getwd() to determine the current working directory.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Assign the value (the path) of the current working directory to a variable
    called "old.dir".
  CorrectAnswer: old.dir <- getwd()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='old.dir <- getwd()')
  Hint: Type old.dir <- getwd() to assign the value of the current working 
    directory to a variable called "old.dir" (for "old directory").

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Have a look again at your workspace.
  CorrectAnswer: ls()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ls()')
  Hint: Type ls() to view all the objects in your workspace.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The object old.dir is there. Now type old.dir
  CorrectAnswer: old.dir
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='old.dir')
  Hint: Type old.dir
  
- Class: text
  Output: It gives the path to the current directory. We will use old.dir at the end of this lesson to move back to the 
    place that we started.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can save your current workspace as binary file "ST07.RData", using the function save.image(). Go ahead and try!
  CorrectAnswer: save.image(file="ST07.RData")
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('save.image(file="ST07.RData")', 'save.image("ST07.RData")')
  Hint: Type save.image(file="ST07.RData") to save your workspace as a binary file.

- Class: text
  Output: This is the same like answering "yes" to the question "Save workspace image?" when you quit R.
    
- Class: text
  Output: You can also save a single object as binary file so that you can load that object in a later session.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Save x to a binary file called "myx.RData", using the function save(). 
  CorrectAnswer: save(x,file="myx.RData")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='save(x,file="myx.RData")')
  Hint: Type save(x,file="myx.RData") to save the object x as a binary file.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You have now saved these items in your working directory as binary files (.RData files). List all the files in your working directory using list.files() or 
    dir().
  CorrectAnswer: list.files()
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('list.files()', 'dir()')
  Hint: Type list.files() or dir() to see all the files in your working directory.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now you can remove the object x from your workspace, using the rm() function. You will be able to reload it later from the binary file. 
  CorrectAnswer: rm(x)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='rm(x)')
  Hint: Type rm(x)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Have a look again at your workspace.
  CorrectAnswer: ls()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ls()')
  Hint: Type ls() to view all the objects in your workspace.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Here is a trick for removing all objects in your workspace. Remember that the output of ls() gives you the names of all objects in the workspace? 
    You can thus use ls() as an argument of rm(). Type rm(list=ls())
  CorrectAnswer: rm(list=ls())
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='rm(list=ls())')
  Hint: Type rm(list=ls())

- Class: text
  Output: What you just did is called "nesting functions"! You used a function "ls()" as an argument of another function "rm()".

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: As we go through this lesson, you can consult the help page 
    for each function at any moment. You should use this help without moderation! Check out the help page for list.files with the
    command ?list.files. This will either open up inside RStudio, or a new page in your web browser.
  CorrectAnswer: ?list.files
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('?list.files', '?dir', 'help("list.files")', 'help("dir")')
  Hint: Type ?list.files to see the help page.

- Class: text
  Output: One of the most helpful parts of any R help file is the See Also 
    section. Read that section for list.files. Some of these functions may be 
    used in later portions of this lesson.

- Class: text
  Output: Using the args() function on a function name is also a handy way to 
    see what arguments a function can take. We will discuss functions and arguments
    more later, but for now arguments are how you tell a function what exactly to do,
    including what data to work on. Most functions have sensible defaults.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use the args() function to determine the arguments to list.files().
  CorrectAnswer: args(list.files)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='args(list.files)')
  Hint: Type args(list.files) to see the arguments to list.files.
  
- Class: text
  Output: You can see all the arguments and their defaults listed, similar to the 
    help page for list.files(). Each argument has a default (NULL or FALSE in most cases).
    The important one for our purposes is the argument 'path = "."'. 
    Remember that "path" is the address, or directory location, or folder location. In 
    this case, the "." indicates the current directory.

- Class: text
  Output: It's important to note that R provides a common API (a common
    set of commands) for interacting with files, that way your code will work
    across different kinds of computers (although different operating systems have different conventions regarding the notation of file paths).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can use ".." to look in the directory one level higher up the hierarchy. 
    Type list.files("..").
  CorrectAnswer: list.files("..")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='list.files("..")')
  Hint: Type list.files("..") to look in the directory one level higher up.
  
- Class: text
  Output: We can also look in directories lower down the hierarchy, if there are any. 
    Start typing list.files("./") and press the TAB key to autocomplete
    options for subdirectories (in RStudio) or type in the path to the subdirectory (if you don't have the autocomplete option), if there are any. Feel free to experiment. Remember, you can 
    use play() to leave this lesson temporarily, and return using nxt().
    
- Class: text
  Output: So, these commands are equivalent to opening Windows Explorer or Mac Finder and 
    opening/closing folders and subfolders.
    
- Class: text
  Output: What about creating and deleting folders and files? These operations are straightforward in 
    a GUI, as you know.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use dir.create() to create a directory in the current working 
    directory called "testdir". Look at the arguments or help page if you
    are unsure what to do.
  CorrectAnswer: dir.create("testdir")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dir.create("testdir")')
  Hint: Type dir.create("testdir") to create a directory called "testdir" in the current working 
    directory.

- Class: text
  Output: We will do some work in this new directory and then delete it after
    we are done. This is the R analog to 
    "Take only pictures, leave only footprints."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Set your working directory to "testdir" with the setwd() command. Remember that 
    you could use autocomplete (TAB) to help with this.
  CorrectAnswer: setwd("testdir")
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('setwd("testdir")', 'setwd("testdir/")', 'setwd("./testdir")')
  Hint: Use setwd("testdir") to set your working directory to "testdir".

- Class: text
  Output: In general, you will want your working directory to be someplace 
    sensible, perhaps created for the specific project that you are working on. 
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Create a file in your working directory called "mytest.R" using the
    file.create() function.
  CorrectAnswer: file.create("mytest.R")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='file.create("mytest.R")')
  Hint: file.create("mytest.R") will get the job done!
  
- Class: text
  Output: This file has the extension ".R". Every file has an extension, which 
    tells the computer what kind of file it is and therefore what software
    applications are best able to open it. You are likely familiar with 
    ".xls" and ".doc" files and their Mac equivalents.
    
- Class: text
  Output: The ".R" extension tells your computer that this is a file with R code, 
    and the default will be to open it inside RStudio.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: OK, so "mytest.R" should be the only file in this newly created directory. Let's
    check this by listing all the files in the current directory.
  CorrectAnswer: list.files()
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('list.files()', 'dir()')
  Hint: list.files() shows that the directory only contains mytest.R.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can also specifically check to see if "mytest.R" exists in the working directory using the
    file.exists() function.
  CorrectAnswer: file.exists("mytest.R")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='file.exists("mytest.R")')
  Hint: Use file.exists("mytest.R") to check that a file exists.

- Class: text
  Output: These sorts of functions are excessive for interactive use. But, if 
    you are running a program that loops through a series of files and does some 
    processing on each one, you will want to check to see that each exists before 
    you try to process it.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Access information about the file "mytest.R" by using file.info().
  CorrectAnswer: file.info("mytest.R")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='file.info("mytest.R")')
  Hint: file.info("mytest.R") will do the trick!
  
- Class: text
  Output: This function provides information on the size, various time stamps, and users of
    the file. These might be important in various programming contexts.

- Class: text
  Output: The output of a function has often the structure known in R as "list". In a "list", you can use the $ operator --- e.g., file.info("mytest.R")$mode --- 
    to grab specific items.
    
- Class: text
  Output: You will learn much more about "lists" and "$" as we progress through this course.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Change the name of the file "mytest.R" to "mytest2.R" by using
    file.rename().
  CorrectAnswer: file.rename("mytest.R", "mytest2.R")
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('file.rename("mytest.R", "mytest2.R")', 'file.rename(from = "mytest.R", to = "mytest2.R")')
  Hint: file.rename("mytest.R", "mytest2.R") is the answer. Googling 
    using key words from the question, along with the letter R, will often give 
    you a good hint.

- Class: text
  Output: "Your operating system will provide simpler tools for these sorts 
    of tasks, but having the ability to manipulate files programatically 
    is useful. You might now try to delete mytest.R using 
    file.remove('mytest.R'), but that won't work since mytest.R no longer 
    exists. You have already renamed it."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Make a copy of "mytest2.R" called "mytest3.R" using file.copy(). If you check the 
    help page or arguments, you will see that this function requires two
    pieces of information. The name of the file you want to copy("from = "), and the name
    of the new copied file ("to = ").
  CorrectAnswer: file.copy("mytest2.R", "mytest3.R")
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('file.copy("mytest2.R", "mytest3.R")', 'file.copy(from = "mytest2.R", to = "mytest3.R")')
  Hint: file.copy("mytest2.R", "mytest3.R") works.

- Class: text
  Output: You now have two files in the current directory. That may not seem 
    very interesting. But what if you were working with dozens, or millions, 
    of individual files? In that case, being able to programatically act on 
    many files would be absolutely necessary. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Provide the relative path to the file "mytest3.R" by using file.path().
  CorrectAnswer: file.path("mytest3.R")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='file.path("mytest3.R")')
  Hint: file.path("mytest3.R") works.

- Class: text
  Output: You can use file.path() to construct file and directory paths that are
    independent of the operating system your R code is running on. 
    
- Class: text
  Output: It means that in this function (file.path) you give R the names of the directories in the
    order they are found (i.e., the directory hierarchy). R then handles how these names
    are put together, accounting for the differences between Mac, Windows, Linux, etc.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Pass 'folder1' and 'folder2' as arguments to file.path() to make a platform-independent pathname.
  CorrectAnswer: file.path("folder1", "folder2")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='file.path("folder1", "folder2")')
  Hint: file.path("folder1", "folder2") works.

- Class: text
  Output: The next task is to create a directory in the current working directory
    called "testdir2" and a subdirectory called "testdir3", in one command.

- Class: text
  Output: This task involves again "nesting functions". It means that you will use a function as one of the arguments in another function.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "First, take a look at the documentation for dir.create by entering 
    ?dir.create . Notice the 'recursive' argument. In order to create nested
    directories, 'recursive' must be set to TRUE."
  CorrectAnswer: ?dir.create
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='?dir.create')
  Hint: ?dir.create will show you the docs.

- Class: text
  Output: Notice also that dir.create() takes the argument 'path' (we have already used 
    it when we made the directory 'testdir/', above). We can use file.path() here for this argument. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Create a directory in the current working directory called 
    "testdir2" and a subdirectory for it called "testdir3", all in one command
    by using dir.create() and file.path().
  CorrectAnswer: dir.create(file.path("testdir2", "testdir3"), recursive = TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dir.create(file.path("testdir2", "testdir3"), recursive = TRUE)')
  Hint: "dir.create(file.path('testdir2', 'testdir3'), recursive = TRUE) will do 
    the trick. If you forgot the recursive argument, the command may have 
    appeared to work, but it didn't create the nested directory."

- Class: text
  Output: Now, to go back to the original working directory, we want the object old.dir back in our workspace!
    Recall that we created the variable old.dir with the full path for the orginal working 
    directory at the start of these questions. We removed this object, but before that, we saved the workspace as "ST07_RData".

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Reload the objects that you stored as "ST07.RData", using the function "load()". Recall that we 
    created "ST07_RData" in the directory just upstream of your current working directory. You have to specify this path in the argument!
  CorrectAnswer: load("../ST07.RData")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='load("../ST07.RData")')
  Hint: Type load("../ST07.RData")

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Have a look again at your workspace.
  CorrectAnswer: ls()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ls()')
  Hint: Type ls() to view all the objects in your workspace.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Go back to your original working directory using setwd().
  CorrectAnswer: setwd(old.dir)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='setwd(old.dir)')
  Hint: Use setwd(old.dir).

- Class: text
  Output: "After you finish this lesson delete the 'testdir' directory that 
    you just left (and everything in it)"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can do this using the unlink() function. We also need to run this
    function recursively, so that it deletes all the files and folders within 
    testdir/. Type unlink(x = "testdir/", recursive = TRUE).
  CorrectAnswer: unlink(x = "testdir/", recursive = TRUE)   
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('unlink(x = "testdir/", recursive = TRUE)', 'unlink(x = "testdir", recursive = TRUE)', 
    'unlink("testdir/", recursive = TRUE)', unlink("testdir", recursive = TRUE))
  Hint: Use unlink(x = "testdir/", recursive = TRUE)
  
- Class: text
  Output: "In this lesson, you learned how to examine your R workspace and 
  work with the file system of your machine from within R. Thanks for playing!"
 
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Please submit the log of this lesson to Google Forms so
    that Rebecca may evaluate your progress.
  AnswerChoices: Sure, no problem
  CorrectAnswer: Sure, no problem
  AnswerTests: submit_log()
  Hint: hint, select "Sure, no problem"!
